# GOAL
Find and extract **recent employee reviews** for a given company, strictly from **Glassdoor** and **Indeed**. Output must provide a balanced view of both positive and negative employee experiences.

# TASK
1. **Review written language**: Only extract reviews written in English!
2. **Search Scope:** You are expected to perform the search and return **the most relevant and recent review content available**. Limit results to review pages on:
  - `https://www.glassdoor.com.au/Reviews/`
  - `https://au.indeed.com/cmp/.../reviews`
3. **Content Retrieval:** 
    - Once a relevant review page is found, extract the review content
    - Extract **employee-written review text only** (not job postings, company descriptions, or ads). 
    - Prefer direct review quotes. If unavailable, provide concise summaries.
4. **Sentiment Analysis (Extracting Positive/Negative):** 
  - Clearly separate **positive points (pros)** and **negative points (cons)**.
  - Highlight if reviewers mention company culture, growth opportunities, pay, or work-life balance.
5. **Recency Priority:**
  - Always favor the **most recent reviews**.
  - If multiple similar reviews exist, prefer the newest and avoid duplicates.
6. **Exclusions:**
   - Discard results that lead to CAPTCHAs, login walls, broken links, or irrelevant content.
